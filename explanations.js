  // Week 1, 4 axis cost&benefit
  "4-axis-Cost-Benefit": `
     <h3>A. Cost/Benefit axis</h3>
  <p>
    The first panel compares total benefit <em>B(h)</em> and total cost <em>C(h)</em>. 
    The vertical distance between the two curves is net benefit. 
    At \\(h = 3.5\\)\\), this gap is largest, so it is our candidate optimal choice.
  </p>
  
  <h3>B. Marginal Benefit / Marginal Cost axis</h3>
  <p>
    The second panel shows marginal benefit \\(MB(h) = \\frac{dB(h)}{dh}\\) and marginal cost \\(MC(h) = \\frac{C(h)}{dh}\\). 
    MB(h) and MC(h) are derivatives of B(h) and C(h) (Graph A).
    The optimal choice occurs where \\(MB = MC\\), the benefit of spending another hour is the same as the cost of it. 
    Which happens at <em>h = 3.5</em>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>C. Net Benefit axis</h3>
  <p>
    The third panel plots net benefit \\(NB(h)\\) maps out the gap between B(h) and C(h) in graph A. 
    The best choice is where this curve reaches its maximum. 
    At that point the slope of net benefit is zero, so 
    \\(NB(h) = \\frac{dNB(h)}{dh} = 0\\) at \\(h = 3.5\\).
  </p>
  
  <h3>D. Marginal Net Benefit axis</h3>
  <p>
    The last panel shows marginal net benefit, which is the derivative of NB (Graph C.) 
    \\(NB(h) = MB − MC\\). 
    The optimum is where this curve crosses zero. 
    At \\(h = 3.5\\), marginal net benefit equals zero, which is equivalent to 
    choosing the point where marginal benefit equals marginal cost and net benefit is maximized.

  //Week1 Elasticity-Flexible-Demand
  "Elasticity-Flexible-Demand": ` 
  <p>Elasticity of demand is computed using the point elasticity formula:\\[E_d = \\frac{dQ}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P}{Q}\\]</p>
  <p>
    Notice that elasticity of demand remains <b>constant</b> at all price level, it is because the Demand curve is a power function. 
    In the example, \\(E_d = -2\\), meaning quantity demanded changes by 2% for every 1% increase in price.</p>
`,

   //Week1 Elasticity-Staircase-Demand
  "Elasticity-Staircase-Demand": `
  <p>This graph shows a staircase (step) demand curve, where quantity changes only at discrete price levels. Because the curve is piecewise vertical and 
    horizontal, elasticity behaves very differently from smooth demand curves.
  </p>

  <p><b>Vertical segments:</b></p>
  <p>When the curve is vertical except at \\(Q = 0\\), quantity does not react to price changes, thus, the elasticity of demand is 0.</p>

  <p><b>Horizontal segments:</b></p>
  <p>On horizontal steps, price does not change (\\( dP = 0 \\)), the percentage change in price is zero, so demand elasticity is undefined.</p>

   //Week1 Lectorial
  "Lectorial": `
   <p>Suppose that you can hire a mechanic to work on your car for up to six hours to locate issues and adress them.</p>
    <p>The total benefit of repair work is: \\(B(H)=654H-40H^2\\); The total cost is \\(C(H)=110H+40H^2\\)</p>
    <p>H refers to the number of hours. What is your best choice?</sup></p>
  `,

  //Week1 Ans
  "Lectorialans": `
   <p>1. Compute the net benefit function: \\(NB(H) = B(H) − C(H) = 544H − 80H^2\\)</p>
   <p>2. Find the optimal number of hours by maximizing NB(H).This requires setting the derivative of NB(H) equal to zero:</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\(frac{dNB}{dH} = 544 − 160H = 0\\)</p>
   <p>3. Solve for H -> \\(H = 3.4\\) hours</p>
   <p>Since 3.4 hours is below the 6-hour limit, the mechanic should be hired for 3.4 hours.</p>

  //Week1 Market-interventions-revised
  "Market-interventions-revised": `
  <h3>Welfare</h3>
  <p><strong>Consumer Surplus (CS):</strong> The area <u>below the demand curve</u> and <u>above the price consumers pay</u>. It measures buyers’ gain from paying less than their maximum willingness to pay.</p>
  <p><strong>Producer Surplus (PS):</strong> The area <u>above the supply curve</u> and <u>below the price sellers receive</u>. It measures producers’ gain from receiving a price higher than their minimum willingness to sell.</p>
  <p><strong>Government revenue or expenditure:</strong> 
     - Revenue (e.g., tax) is shown as a rectangle between buyer and seller prices, multiplied by quantity traded.<br>
     - Expenditure (e.g., subsidy) is the opposite: the government pays the rectangle.</p>
  <p><strong>Deadweight Loss (DWL):</strong> The triangular area representing lost total surplus when quantity traded <u>moves away from competitive equilibrium</u>.</p>
  
  <h3>No intervention</h3>
  <p>The market reaches its competitive equilibrium where supply meets demand. 
     Consumer surplus and producer surplus are maximized, and <strong>there is no deadweight loss</strong>. 
     This outcome is the benchmark against which all other policies are compared.</p>

  <h3>Tax on producers</h3>
  <p>A per-unit tax shifts the supply curve upward by the tax amount. 
     Buyers face a higher price, sellers receive a lower price, and quantity falls.</p>
  <p><strong>Welfare:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>CS shrinks because buyers pay more.</li>
    <li>PS shrinks because sellers receive less.</li>
    <li>Government revenue is the rectangle between buyer and seller prices.</li>
    <li><strong>DWL</strong> appears because the quantity traded is below the efficient level.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Subsidy on producers</h3>
  <p>A per-unit subsidy shifts the supply curve downward. 
     Buyers pay less, sellers receive more, and quantity increases beyond the competitive level.</p>
  <p><strong>Welfare:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>CS increases.</li>
    <li>PS increases.</li>
    <li>Government expenditure equals the subsidy per unit times the quantity traded.</li>
    <li><strong>DWL</strong> arises because quantity exceeds the efficient competitive level.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Price floor</h3>
  <p>A binding price floor sets a minimum price above equilibrium. 
     Quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, creating a surplus.</p>
  <p><strong>Welfare:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>CS decreases because buyers face a higher price.</li>
    <li>PS may increase for inframarginal sellers but overall total PS is limited to the quantity actually purchased.</li>
    <li>Government may need to buy up the surplus (depends on policy design).</li>
    <li><strong>DWL</strong> emerges because output is restricted to the smaller of Q_d and Q_s.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Production quota</h3>
  <p>A quota restricts the maximum quantity that can be sold. 
     If the quota is below equilibrium output, price rises and quantity falls.</p>
  <p><strong>Welfare:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>CS decreases because prices rise.</li>
    <li>PS may increase for sellers who still operate (higher price), but the total PS area is smaller.</li>
    <li>No government revenue or expenditure.</li>
    <li><strong>DWL</strong> results from restricting output below the competitive level.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Voluntary reduction</h3>
  <p>Firms voluntarily limit production or emissions, often in response to social pressure or industry agreements. 
     Quantity supplied is reduced, raising the market price.</p>
  <p><strong>Welfare:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>CS decreases due to higher price.</li>
    <li>PS depends: price increases benefit sellers, but reduced quantity limits total surplus.</li>
    <li>No government revenue or expenditure.</li>
    <li><strong>DWL</strong> arises because output is below the efficient competitive level.</li>
  </ul>
