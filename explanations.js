  // Week 1, 4 axis cost&benefit
  "4-axis-Cost-Benefit": `
     <h3>A. Cost/Benefit axis</h3>
  <p>
    The first panel compares total benefit <em>B(h)</em> and total cost <em>C(h)</em>. 
    The vertical distance between the two curves is net benefit. 
    At \\(h = 3.5\\)\\), this gap is largest, so it is our candidate optimal choice.
  </p>
  
  <h3>B. Marginal Benefit / Marginal Cost axis</h3>
  <p>
    The second panel shows marginal benefit \\(MB(h) = \\frac{dB(h)}{dh}\\) and marginal cost \\(MC(h) = \\frac{C(h)}{dh}\\). 
    MB(h) and MC(h) are derivatives of B(h) and C(h) (Graph A).
    The optimal choice occurs where \\(MB = MC\\), the benefit of spending another hour is the same as the cost of it. 
    Which happens at <em>h = 3.5</em>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>C. Net Benefit axis</h3>
  <p>
    The third panel plots net benefit \\(NB(h)\\) maps out the gap between B(h) and C(h) in graph A. 
    The best choice is where this curve reaches its maximum. 
    At that point the slope of net benefit is zero, so 
    \\(NB(h) = \\frac{dNB(h)}{dh} = 0\\) at \\(h = 3.5\\).
  </p>
  
  <h3>D. Marginal Net Benefit axis</h3>
  <p>
    The last panel shows marginal net benefit, which is the derivative of NB (Graph C.) 
    \\(NB(h) = MB − MC\\). 
    The optimum is where this curve crosses zero. 
    At \\(h = 3.5\\), marginal net benefit equals zero, which is equivalent to 
    choosing the point where marginal benefit equals marginal cost and net benefit is maximized.

  //Week1 Elasticity-Flexible-Demand
  "Elasticity-Flexible-Demand": ` 
  <p>Elasticity of demand is computed using the point elasticity formula:\\[E_d = \\frac{dQ}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P}{Q}\\]</p>
  <p>
    Notice that elasticity of demand remains <b>constant</b> at all price level, it is because the Demand curve is a power function. 
    In the example, \\(E_d = -2\\), meaning quantity demanded changes by 2% for every 1% increase in price.</p>
`,

   //Week1 Elasticity-Staircase-Demand
  "Elasticity-Staircase-Demand": `
  <p>This graph shows a staircase (step) demand curve, where quantity changes only at discrete price levels. Because the curve is piecewise vertical and 
    horizontal, elasticity behaves very differently from smooth demand curves.
  </p>

  <p><b>Vertical segments:</b></p>
  <p>When the curve is vertical except at \\(Q = 0\\), quantity does not react to price changes, thus, the elasticity of demand is 0.</p>

  <p><b>Horizontal segments:</b></p>
  <p>On horizontal steps, price does not change (\\( dP = 0 \\)), the percentage change in price is zero, so demand elasticity is undefined.</p>

  //Week1 Ans
  "Lectorialans": `
   <p>1. Compute the net benefit function: \\(NB(H) = B(H) − C(H) = 544H − 80H^2\\)</p>
   <p>2. Find the optimal number of hours by maximizing NB(H).This requires setting the derivative of NB(H) equal to zero:</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\(frac{dNB}{dH} = 544 − 160H = 0\\)</p>
   <p>3. Solve for H -> \\(H = 3.4\\) hours</p>
   <p>Since 3.4 hours is below the 6-hour limit, the mechanic should be hired for 3.4 hours.</p>
