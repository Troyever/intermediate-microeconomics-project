      <h2>How to use these exercises</h2>
      <p>
        These activities are designed for short in-class tasks or homework.
        Each graph usually comes with a small set of questions or prompts
        (which you can host in LMS / PDF / or the video description).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also run them live: set a slider value, ask students what
        happens, then reveal the answer by moving the slider.
      </p>
